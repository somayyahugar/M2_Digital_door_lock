**SWOT Analysis**
**Strength**
1) Pick-proof: Because there is no place for a key with these locks, the prevent break-ins because burglars are unable to pick or 'bump' the lock. Criminals methods of breaking and entering are improving and the majority of criminals can pick an ordinary key lock.
2) NO MORE KEYS!: user won't have to carry around a large set of keys and they will be less likely to be lost or stolen. Also, if you are a landlord, you don't have to give residents keys or replace them if they lose them. 

**Weakness**
1)  Forgetful?: You may be the one to forget your keys now and then, and it can be easy to forget you PIN code for the lock and when your in a rush to get into the room or building or it is night time and dark.
2)  Keep the PIN code safe and the lock clean: Only tell the code to people who you trust, as you don't want a code to your property to be local news. When the lock has been used a few too many times, the coating may start to come away or mucky fingerprints may start to occur on the buttons. Keep the lock maintained and clean to stop unwanted people finding out the code.
3)  Power Failure: Some digital door locks are powered by electricity, if your house or building has a power failure, then the door lock will not work which restricts you from entering the building. Buying a mechanical or battery powered lock will not affect you if there is a power failure.
