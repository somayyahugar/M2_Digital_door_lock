    Security is a prime concern in our day-today life. Everyone wants to be as much secure aspossible.   An   access   control   for   doors   forms   a   vital  link   in   a   security   chain.   
    This project is a ATMEGA328 microcontroller based digital door lock system using keypad which will provide complete security solution to lives and properties at homes,schools and offices. The security system contains a 4X4 keypad
input unit for entering the Personal Identification Number (PIN)
and a display unit in form of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) for
visual display of information. It also contain a DC motor that
serves as a switching for locking and unlocking the door and a
programmed microcontroller that processes the input
information and take appropriate action. When a user enters a
PIN into the security system installed at any entrance, the system
captures the PIN and compares it with the stored PINs for a
match. If the captured PIN matches with any of the stored PINs,
access granted is displayed on the LCD and the door opens;
otherwise, access denied is displayed on the LCD and the door
remains closed.
